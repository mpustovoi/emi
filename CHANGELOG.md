### Additions
* Added visibility options for the EMI config and recipe tree buttons
* EMI config button now is visible by default when toggled, to prevent people from accidentally hiding the mod without knowing how to undo it

### Tweaks

* EMI config enum selection screen now is consistent with the rest of the config screen on later versions

### Fixes
* Fixed JEI dependency on 1.19 versions #780
* Fixed stack default bind not toggling in recipe tree
* #689
